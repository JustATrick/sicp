a.

Louis's plan forgets that prodcedure applications are defined as 'any compound
expression that is not one of the above expression types': we can only
recognise an expression as an application AFTER testing for all other
expressions types. Moving the test for application earlier in the eval
procedure will only cause expressions which are not procedure applications to
be erroneously evaluated as such. e.g. (define x 3) will be interpreted as an
attempt to apply a procedure named define to the value of x and 3, when in fact
it should be interpreted as a special form.

(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
