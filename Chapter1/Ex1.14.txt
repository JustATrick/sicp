The following will give a nicely formatted process tree:

I'd shakily suggest that the number of steps grows as \theta(x^n), while the
space grows as \theta(n).

I arrive at this basically by analogy to the Fibonacci case, and from noticing
that, ignoring the first-denomination calls, the cc calls basically bifurcate,
but often (at least at the low end) one of the branches is still-born, leading
the the "long-tails". Such tails are \theta(n) in number of steps. If there
were no still-born branches, then the whole thing would be \theta(2^n) in
number of steps. Reality is somewhere between the two, but I guess we have to
go with the worst case behaviour of \theta(x^n).

For space I guess a similar shaky argument applies...
